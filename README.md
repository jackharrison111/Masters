# Masters

This repo is used for the shared Masters project on finding new physics through tau lepton decays using the ATLAS detector at CERN.

This project is a collaboration between Jack Harrison and Aodhan Burke. 

The code uses the ROOT analysis software and locally stored data from the ATLAS detector.
